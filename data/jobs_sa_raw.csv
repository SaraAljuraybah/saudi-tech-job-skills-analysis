What You'll Do

As a Staff AI Engineer, you'll define and lead the technical direction for production-grade AI systems across the company. You won't just build agentsyou'll design the platforms, patterns, and guardrails that other engineers rely on to ship AI safely and at scale.

You'll architect end-to-end AI systems such as customer intelligence agents, internal copilots, automated workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) platforms used by multiple teams. You'll work with modern frameworks like LangGraph, LlamaIndex, AWS Agent Core, or Vertex AI Agent Builder, and make principled decisions about when to use themand when not to.

This is not a research role.

It's senior-level engineering leadership with deep hands-on ownership. You'll set standards, review designs, mentor engineers, and still write production code when it matters most. You'll be accountable for reliability, cost, and long-term maintainability of AI systems running in production.

ï Drive LLM cost optimization strategies at scale
ï Implement rollout strategies using feature flags, canaries, and staged deployments
ï Ensure security, compliance, and PII protection in AI systems
ï Team & Org Impact:
ï Mentor senior and mid-level engineers in AI systems engineering
ï Raise the engineering bar through code reviews, design guidance, and shared tooling
ï Partner with product, data, and leadership to shape the AI roadmap
ï Turn ambiguous business problems into clear technical plans

Required Technical Skills
ï AI Systems Engineering:

ï Deep expertise in LLM orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, AWS Agent Core, or similar)
ï Strong understanding of RAG systems: embeddings, chunking strategies, hybrid retrieval, reranking
ï Experience treating prompts as production artifacts: versioning, testing, evaluation, rollback
ï Software Engineering Excellence:
ï Advanced Python engineering with strong system design fundamentals
ï Experience building distributed, async, and event-driven systems
ï Testing strategies for non-deterministic systems (prompt tests, golden datasets, eval pipelines)
ï Ability to debug complex failures across multiple services and AI components

Your Role

Weíre looking for a staff-level, hands-on engineer at the intersection of Developer Productivity, DevEx, and AI to make our engineering organization more effective.

In this role, youíll identify bottlenecks across the developer lifecycle (planning ? coding ? review ? testing ? release ? incident response ? onboarding) and build internal tools and agentic workflows that measurably improve delivery speed and quality.

Youíll operate with an AI-first mindset: rapidly experiment with the latest coding agents and AI workflow patterns to see whatís possible today, forecast whatís likely to become viable in the next 3ñ6 months, and pragmatically fall back to conventional tooling when AI isnít the right fit. Youíll own discovery, roadmap, and backlog end-to-end, run short data-driven trials, and productionize what works.

Youíll work closely with the CTO, Engineering, DevOps/Infrastructure, Security, and Product to ensure everything integrates cleanly into existing workflows and raises the bar on quality, not just speed.

Your Responsibilities
ï Design and implement agentic workflows for requirements clarification, planning, PR generation, and refinement, with human-in-the-loop and safety gates by default.
ï Develop internal tools across IDEs, GitHub, Slack, and web apps to accelerate the SDLC and create consistent ìgolden paths.î
ï Build and maintain integrations with internal systems (CI, docs, metrics, task trackers) to enable context-rich agent behavior.
ï Automate high-leverage workflows like refactors, scaffolding, test generation, and documentation updates with LLM and AST-based tools.
ï Lead discovery and roadmap definition through engineer interviews, telemetry, and measurable outcome setting.
ï Drive adoption via enablement programsóplaybooks, office hours, promptsóand ensure agentic workflows become default.
ï Maintain operational excellence: tool monitoring, versioning, support, and deprecation processes.

What You'll Need
ï 5+ years of experience building internal tooling, developer platforms, or CI/CD automation.
ï Proven experience integrating LLMs into workflows with prompting, retrieval, and quality evaluation.
ï Familiarity with structured/agentic workflows and tool-use protocols like MCP or equivalents.
ï Strong understanding of CI/CD, test strategy, and quality tooling for reliable, fast engineering loops.
ï Product-thinking mindset with a track record of driving measurable dev productivity improvements.
ï Excellent cross-functional communication skills; comfort enabling change through docs, demos, and async channels.

Preferred Qualifications
ï Experience rolling out AI coding tools (e.g., Claude, Codex, Copilot) with org-wide standards and adoption frameworks.
ï Strong evaluation skills for LLM output (rubrics, golden tasks, human-in-the-loop reviews).
ï Background in large-scale code migrations or refactors using AST-based automation.
ï Familiarity with observability practices for developer platforms and performance tuning AI workloads.
ï Experience in regulated or high-integrity domains where safety, correctness, and auditability are critical.

Q is a large-scale
retail and e-commerce company
operating in the consumer market with a strong and growing customer base.

We serve a high-volume, real-world retail operation combined with a rapidly expanding digital platform, where technology is a core driver of customer experience, efficiency, and scale.

Our products are used daily by real customers, and our systems operate under real production pressure.

This environment demands AI systems that are reliable, practical, and deeply integrated into the product, not experimental or theoretical.

We are looking for a
Senior / Principal Applied AI Engineer
to lead the
design and hands-on implementation
of the core AI layer within the
Q
application.

AI at Q is
not an experiment, not a cosmetic feature, and not a side add-on
.

It is a fundamental part of the product and the customer experience. This role will have a direct impact on how users interact with the application and make their daily decisions faster and smarter.

This is a
hands on execution and technical planning role
.

It is
not
a managerial or supervisory position. We are looking for an engineer who builds systems, plans them, and takes full ownership of their success in production.

Role Core

You will be responsible for designing and building
end-to-end AI systems
that run in production inside the application, from initial concept to full-scale deployment.

ï Understands the user and their intent.
ï Saves users time and effort.
ï Delivers what truly fits their needs within the Q experience.
ï Operates reliably at scale in a real-world production environment.

Scope of Responsibility
ï Design and build production-grade AI systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs).
ï Build and operate RAG systems and connect models to Q's data and systems via tools and APIs.
ï Own the full AI system lifecycle: design, development, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
ï Make informed technical decisions that directly impact experience quality, performance, and cost.
ï Work closely with product and engineering teams to understand user behavior and translate it into executable intelligent logic.
ï Drive long-term technical planning while remaining deeply involved in hands-on execution.

Required Experience (Non-Negotiable)
ï Proven experience building
AI systems that reached production
and are actively used by real users.
ï Experience working within product teams and companies,
not freelance projects or experimental prototypes
.
ï A clear track record of delivering end-to-end systems that handle daily production load.
ï Experience working on large-scale consumer products or platforms.

Knowledge and Capabilities
ï Deep understanding of how to apply Large Language Models within real products.
ï Strong experience designing and implementing RAG systems connected to live data.
ï Ability to choose technical solutions based on
customer value and business impact
, not technical novelty.
ï Strong proficiency in Python or a suitable language for building production AI systems.
ï Real understanding of user experience and how it translates into system logic and decision-making.
ï Ability to balance quality, performance, and cost.

What Sets the Ideal Candidate Apart
ï Has built systems that run in production, not demos or proofs of concept.
ï Thinks like both an engineer and a product builder.
ï Sees AI as a tool to serve users, not an end in itself.
ï Operates with full ownership and accountability for outcomes after launch.

Important Notes
ï This role is
not managerial
.
ï This role is
not research or academic
.
ï We are looking for an engineer who plans, builds, and executes systems the product truly depends on.

Why Join Q
ï You will work on a
real product with real users
, not internal tools or experimental labs.
ï Your work will have
direct, visible impact
on customer experience and business outcomes.
ï You will help build a core AI system from the ground up, not optimize a marginal feature.
ï You will operate with a high level of technical ownership and trust.
ï You will be part of a company that values clarity, execution, and long-term system thinking over hype.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

This is a general selection process for software engineers focused on virtualisation and container technology - from the kernel through userspace. Apply here if you are an exceptional Go, Rust, or C/C++ software engineer and want to work on next-generation open source VMM or container technology, or related open source networking and storage.

Container, virtualisation and cloud infrastructure have become essentials of modern software deployments. We invest in open source related to application isolation, workload orchestration, system or OCI containers, micro service architecture or cloud infrastructure.

Here are some examples of projects under way at Canonical.

RustVMM has great potential as a new hypervisor for Linux. We are building a team to work on this, with an emphasis on performance, security and operability. Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.

Docker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor. Canonical is in a good position to publish a portfolio of outstanding Docker images. Our Rockcraft team is designing and implementing an elevated Docker image experience for the open source community.

LXD is a modern system container and virtual machine manager that is widely used on Ubuntu, ChromeOS and other Linux platforms. LXD engineering spans the entire software stack from low-level kernel work on namespaces, confinement, security, filesystems, VMMs and networking, to the high level management REST API and CLI.

Members of the Kubernetes product team build MicroK8s for on-rails K8s, and Charmed Kubernetes for more sophisticated integration. We work on K8s itself and on the operations tooling around it.

The OpenStack team deliver Charmed OpenStack, OVN / OVS and Ceph. This work brings cloud platform technologies to large-scale computing environments.

These teams hire system level C/C++, Golang, Rust and Python developers to work on security-critical, performance-critical and mission-critical code, focused on software delivery, containers, security, sandboxing, application orchestration and management. Our teams are motivated to have a meaningful impact on modern cloud computing technologies.

Implement robust solutions for resource allocation (CPU, GPU, memory), task scheduling, and priority management across a fleet of edge devices.

Performance Optimization:

Profile and fine-tune the performance of AI/CV pipelines on the Jetson platform, diving deep into the Linux environment to resolve bottlenecks.

Backend & API Development:

Build and maintain scalable backend services and APIs (e.g., REST, gRPC) that allow for remote deployment, monitoring, and updating of tasks.

Deployment & CI/CD:
Improve automated deployment pipelines for pushing new AI models and orchestration logic to devices in the field.

∑ Collaborate with web ) and mobile (React Native) to shape API contracts and deliver end?to?end flows (onboarding, payment experiences).

∑ Contribute pragmatic fixes or features on the frontend to unblock delivery while maintaining code quality and i18n/RTL considerations.

Operations & reliabilityProduct lifecycle & documentation

∑ Contribute across the full product lifecycle: from discovery and design through implementation, testing, deployment, and iteration.

∑ Ensure key decisions are captured: keep code, architecture (C4 diagrams), and technical decisions documented for future reference.

∑ Own CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), container builds, and Kubernetes Helm?based deployments on AWS.

∑ Instrument services using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, and OpenTelemetry; define SLOs/alerts for payment and payout health.

∑ Drive incident analysis, root cause remediation, and continuous improvement.

Technology vision and architecture

We build working software with excellent architecture, iterate quickly from MVP to production, and keep documentation accurate yet lean. We use microservices with clear boundaries and C4 diagrams to communicate intent. Internationalization for English and Arabic is a core capability, not an afterthought.

Our stack

∑ Languages & frameworks: Golang (backend), TypeScript with and React Native (frontends).

∑ Architecture: Microservices; C4 model documentation; contract?first APIs.

∑ Identity & security: Keycloak (OAuth2/OIDC), token management, signature verification for callbacks, secure secret handling.

∑ Payments & fintech: Hosted payment pages, wallets, API/SDK integrations, payouts, reconciliation, status mapping and error handling.

∑ Infrastructure: AWS (Docker images in ECR), Kubernetes with Helm, GitHub Actions CI/CD, GitOps?style workflows.

∑ Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry.

What we're looking forMust?have

∑ Senior?level experience building production Golang services and RESTful microservices.

∑ Strong background with third?party API integrations, webhooks/callbacks, and asynchronous workflows with idempotency and retries.

∑ Hands?on with AWS (or similar), containers, CI/CD, and familiarity with Kubernetes and Helm.

∑ Security?minded: authN/authZ, token handling, secret management, signature verification for payment events.

∑ Testing discipline: unit and integration tests; monitoring, logging, and tracing in production.

∑ Experience building modern web applications and ideally mobile apps (React Native) as part of full-stack delivery, with the willingness to jump into the frontend when needed to deliver end-to-end value.

∑ Strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and clear written and verbal communication; comfortable working in a small, fast-moving, founder-led team.

Nice?to?have

∑ Keycloak or similar identity providers; deep OAuth2/OIDC experience.

∑ Payment gateways and payouts in MENA; reconciliation and settlement expertise.

∑ Internationalization/i18n for English/Arabic and RTL considerations.

How we work

∑ Architecture?first: invest in C4 diagrams and design reviews before large changes.

∑ Iterative delivery: ship small, safe increments with strong automation and observability.

∑ Lean but clear documentation: keep Confluence up to date with designs, APIs, runbooks, and key technical decisions.

∑ Close collaboration: work directly with founders, product, and design to scope features, refine requirements, and ship impactful improvements quickly.",FALSE,ﬁ»· ??

We equip every developer to build successful products.

We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort.

We've since shipped more than a dozen products, including a built-in data warehouse, a customer data platform, and Max AI, an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries.

Next on the roadmap are messaging, customer analytics, ai task creation and coding based on customer data, logs and support analytics.

Our values are not a poster on the wall full of aspiration. They've come from how we really work, day in day out.

PostHog is open source product led, and a default alive company that is well funded.
What you'll be doing

As a Full Stack Software Engineer on the Data Stack team, you'll build end user tools for understanding and traversing their data models.

You'll work on materializing user defined queries, and schedule & resolve DAGs of query materialization.

You'll debug stateful data workflows by digging into k8s pod metrics, and schedule jobs using As you can see, there's a huge breadth of challenges and opportunities to tackle, and nothing is off-limits.

The PostHog Data Stack is both a core product for our users and a foundational platform for our internal teams. Data is a first-class product at PostHog, not an afterthought.

You will have the chance to push the boundaries of what our Data Stack team can do while ensuring we remain stable and production-ready.

You now know what you'll be doing, but what about what you'll need to bring along?
You'll fit right in if:
ï You're a builder. You bring strong skills in building resilient systems, with experience in Kubernetes, Docker, and S3 at scale. We build in python. Async-python and skills are welcome.
ï You have good practices around building resilient systems. Logging, testing and monitoring (observability), but you are also comfortable with debugging stateful, async data workflows by digging into k8s pod metrics.
ï You are proficient in building UIs for data intensive tools. React is part of your toolset.
ï You have experience designing and implementing reliable and highly available backend services . Having used Dbt is a plus.
ï You bring a mix of skills. It's not just about the query engine. You'll need strong backend skills as we run a complex system.
ï You love getting things done. Engineers at PostHog have an incredible amount of autonomy to decide what to work on, so you'll need to be proactive and just git it done.
ï You're ready to do the best work of your career. We have incredible distribution, a big financial cushion and an amazing team. There's probably no better place to see how far you can go.

If this sounds like you, we should talk.

We are committed to ensuring a fair and accessible interview process. If you need any accommodations or adjustments, please let us know

Weíre a remote-first, distributed software company with team members spread across the globe. We help startups and scaling companies build products and grow their engineering teams.

Why do people join Clearview? To make an impact. To grow as people and professionals. To enjoy schedule flexibility unlike anything theyíve ever experienced in a workplace. To be surrounded by developers who they can learn from. We are truly excited to be creating waves in an industry under transformation.

We bring Clearview teammates on as full-time contractors, but our list of benefits looks nothing like traditional contract freelancing. We offer all our teammates:
ï Unparalleled flexibility of working hours --which means operationalized family-first, soul-first values
ï Paid skill expansion (so you can keep growing as you work with us).
ï Coworking (or home office optimization) budget
ï A local meet-up budget for our co-located teammates to hang out outside of work
ï Annual summits , for company-wide face time

True innovation comes from an exchange of knowledge across all of our teams. To put people on the path to success, we nurture a culture built on trust, collaboration, and personal growth. You will often work independently, but when youíre working on a team it will be a small, feature-based, cross-functional team. One thing you can be certain of: You will be empowered to take ownership.

Job Description

Are you an exceptionally strong, mid-to-senior Backend Developer with an independent mindset? Do you want to work remotely on challenging projects within a great community? Sounds like youíll be a great fit for Clearview.

We are currently seeking a mid-to-senior-career engineer with ironclad coding skills and the proven ability to work effectively, proactively and independently but within the context of a small, self-directed engineering team.

Qualifications

Youíll need to be:
ï Fluent in the English language, both spoken and written (however: we donít mind which version of the English language it is)
ï Comfortable working effectively, proactively and independently within the context of a small, self-directed team of developers.
ï A fully proactive and self-directed time-management expert, very capable and happy working independently while communicating very regularly with your intercontinental teammates.

What we expect of you:
ï Several years of professional experience in software development
ï Youíll write lots of Node.js code, incorporating best practices, design patterns and frameworks that will last for years to come.
ï Strong experience and understand the ins and outs of JavaScript and Node.js.
ï Extensive experience with Git, GitHub and GitLab
ï Implement automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
ï Create pull requests (While youíre at it, review your teammatesí pull requests too, mentoring the more junior members of our development team.)
ï Youíll participate in design sessions with your team members, coming up with the optimum technical solution: one that not only meets business requirements, but does so with performance, scalability and maintainability in mind.
ï Youíll innovate. Thereís always something we can improve upon, whether it be process or tools or technology choices. If you can dream it, youíll likely get to build it.
ï You have a strong understanding of SQL databases (Postgres, MySQL..), Redis and Elasticsearch

It would be awesome if:
ï You have some experience working remotely (but if youíre a clear communicator with rock-solid reliability and youíre curious about making the leap to remote, weíll guide you through it)

We're shipping every product that companies need from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build products.

We started with open-source product analytics, launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than a dozen products, including:
ï A built-in data warehouse, so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights.
ï A customer data platform, so they can send their data wherever they need with ease.
ï PostHog AI, an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries.

Next on the roadmap are CRM, Workflow, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product, we really mean it

We are:
ï Product-led. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.
ï Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.
ï Default alive. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.

We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as weird as possible.
What you'll be doing

As a Software Engineer on the Warehouse Pipeline team in the Data Stack group, you'll build and iterate on our data import system.

Our import workers are built in python and we pull in data from APIs and databases in batches, process the data using Apache Arrow in memory, and move the data into object storage in open table formats.

You'll build and maintain our source library, as we're looking for creative ways to make our library manageable at scale. You'll revamp our schema management strategy, and build resilient systems (e.g logging, observability, testing)

You'll debug stateful data workflows by digging into k8s pod metrics, and schedule jobs using As you can see, there's a huge breadth of challenges and opportunities to tackle, and nothing is off-limits.

The PostHog Data Stack group provides both a core product for our users and a foundational platform for our internal teams. Data is a first-class product at PostHog, not an afterthought.

You will have the chance to push the boundaries of what our Data Stack team can do while ensuring we remain stable and production-ready.

You now know what you'll be doing, but what about what you'll need to bring along?
You'll fit right in if:
ï You're a builder. You bring strong skills in building resilient systems, with experience in Kubernetes, Docker, and S3 at scale. We build in python. Async-python and skills are welcome.
ï You have hands-on experience with batch processing and modern data formats. We use Arrow to stream data. Experience with Iceberg and/or Delta is welcome, we don't expect you to have experience with all three (although that would be great)
ï You're more than a connector of things. Building pipelines is more than configuring tools to make them work together, it's about actually building the tooling used in data warehousing pipelines. We need you to have experience with building tools versus using off-the-shelf tools
ï You bring experience with creating and maintaining data pipelines. You are comfortable with debugging stateful, async data workflows by digging into k8s pod metrics.
ï You bring a mix of skills. It's not just about the Data Pipeline work. You'll need strong backend skills as we run a complex system.
ï You love getting things done. Engineers at PostHog have an incredible amount of autonomy to decide what to work on, so you'll need to be proactive and just git it done.
ï You're ready to do the best work of your career. We have incredible distribution, a big financial cushion and an amazing team. There's probably no better place to see how far you can go.

If this sounds like you, we should talk.

We are committed to ensuring a fair and accessible interview process. If you need any accommodations or adjustments, please let us know
What's in it for you?
